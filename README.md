# thesis_dtu
Dear reader.

This directory contains the scripts used in my thesis on inter-study variation of the SomaScan platform (a proteomics-based cross-study analysis done in R).
The thesis was written in collaboration with Novo Nordisk and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

There are three main subdirectories - RNA_seq_Mouse, SomaScan_Human, and SomaScan_Mouse.
The first contains scripts used in the analysis of transcriptomics data whereas the two latter contain code designed to work on proteomics data. Each of the subdirectories contain a "final_figures" script which incorporates the other scripts to produce the final figures used in the thesis, including all supplementary figures.
(A small number of figures were produced using graphics editor software instead of R, so these will be missing from the main scripts.)

The data is unavailable as it belongs to Novo Nordisk.
